ALGORITHM: SELECTION SORT (A) 
1. k ← length [A] 
2. for j ←1 to n-1 
3. smallest ← j 
4. for I ← j + 1 to k 
5. if A [i] < A [ smallest] 
6. then smallest ← i 
7. exchange (A [j], A [smallest])
How Selection Sort works 






Best Case Complexity: The selection sort algorithm has a best-case time complexity of O(n2) for the already sorted array. 
Average Case Complexity: The average-case time complexity for the selection sort algorithm is O(n2), in which the existing elements are in jumbled ordered, i.e., neither in the ascending order nor in the descending order. 
Worst Case Complexity: The worst-case time complexity is also O(n2), which occurs when we sort the descending order of an array into the ascending order. 
In the selection sort algorithm, the time complexity is O(n2) in all three cases. This is because, in each step, we are required to find minimum elements so that it can be placed in the correct position. Once we trace the complete array, we will get our minimum element.
